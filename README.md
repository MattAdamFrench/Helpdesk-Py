# Helpdesk-Py
This repo is a copy of my other project [Helpdesk](https://github.com/MattFrench019/Helpdesk) which is the same application, but written with an ASP.NET backend.
I had planned to host the project on Google Cloud, but due to a change of plans I am hosting this locally on a Docker container.
While it is still possible to do this, it is far simpler to use a basic framework like Flask and Python instead of ASP.NET.

### Formatting for React
This will be updated through the project, and documents the semantics of the code.<br>
##### Imports
Code imports should be laid out as follows:
    <ol>
        <li>React Imports
        <li>Programmatic Dependencies (e.g. React Router)
        <li>MaterialUI Components
        <li>Custom Components
        <li>Constants & Contexts
    </ol>
